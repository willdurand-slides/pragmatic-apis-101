# `$ ./academia2industry`

## Abstract

A talk about my professional experiences from academic research to industry.

## About the slides

This slide deck has been written with
[Monod](https://github.com/tailordev/monod), then exported as a Markdown file
(`monod.md`) using <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>. I created a Reveal.js template
made of HTML and CSS (using the same CSS as in Monod), and a tool to fix a few
things in the markdown exported by Monod (`bin/fix` script). The idea of this
slide deck is to have a backup, in case the Internet goes wrong, my laptop
burns, or any other disaster.

Here is my workflow:

1. I write slides in Monod
2. I export the Markdown into this repository
3. I run `bin/fix monod.md`
4. I commit both `monod.md` and `slides.md` (generated by `bin/fix`)
5. I profit!
